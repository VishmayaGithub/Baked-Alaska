STEP 1 :
 Line a small glass bowl with two layers plastic wrap.Make 
 sure you leave a lot hanging over the edge.
STEP 2 :
 Using a spoon fill the bowl with icecream two thirds the way up
 Smooth the top and leave it in the freezer at least for an hour
STEP 3 :
 Preheat the oven to 450 degree fahrenhiet (230 degree celcius)
 To start making the meringue crack the eggs but don't break the yolk
STEP 4 :
 The meringue is only egg white so discard the yolks using a egg cup
STEP 5 : 
 Whisk the egg white until its frothy then add 1/2 teaspoon of
 cream tartar.Keep mixing but stop when forms stiff peaks
STEP 6 :
 Gradually add the sugar and begin beating again
 Keep going until mixture is shiny and stiff
STEP 7 :
 Take the icecream out of the freezer and gently lift it out of the bowl
 using the plstic wrap hangin over and turn it upside down onthe cake
 ensuring it doesn't overlap the edges of the cake. Peel away the plastic wrap
STEP 8 :
 This is where you have to be extra quick.Using a spatula spread the meringue 
 all over the icecream and cake and then using oven mitts put the plat into the
 hot oven and cook it for three minutes or until the outside browns.
